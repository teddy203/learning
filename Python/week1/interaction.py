# Tripple Quotes
# print('''
#       It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by 
#       the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
#       The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
#       as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
#       Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
#       and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
#       Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
#       sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)
